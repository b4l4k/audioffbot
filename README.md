# Telegram Audio Face-Photo Bot

Telegram Audio Photo Bot is a Python application that interacts with Telegram to handle audio and photo messages. It saves audio messages to a database, converts them to WAV format, and detects faces in photos, saving only those with faces.

## Installation

To be able to use the repository, you should have a Telegram bot created.
Once your bot is created you should edit a file named config.py where the api key will be introduced like that API_KEY='your-api-key' (Inside the quotes)

Appart from that is necessary to install all the libraries (from requirements.txt), including ffmpeg and dlib (I attach links where you can find them):
- Link for ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html 
- Link for dlib: https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x
